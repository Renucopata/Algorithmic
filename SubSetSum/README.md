## SubSet Sum
This is a programming problem which consists of finding a sub set within a set that satisfies some property, in this case that the sum of the numbers of the sub set reaches a number for example:

Input: set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 9
Output: True  
There is a subset (4, 5) that added together gives us 9.

Input: set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 30
Output: False
There is no subset that summed together gives us 30.
