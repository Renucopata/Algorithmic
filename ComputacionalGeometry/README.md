## Computational geometry

Computational geometry is a branch of algorithmicÂ´s use to the study the algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry.

In this field the time complexity is very important, with great practical significance if algorithms are used on very large datasets containing tens or hundreds of millions of points. For such sets, the difference between O(n2) and O(n log n) may be the difference between days and seconds of computation.

The code developed in this repository try to some of the basic geometry calculus such as sum, multiplication, division and substraction of vectors, disntance from a point to another, linear intersection, cross and dot product, area calculation and convex/no convex polygons.
