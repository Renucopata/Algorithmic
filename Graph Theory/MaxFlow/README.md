## Maximum flow
In graph theory, a flow network is defined as a directed graph involving a source(s) and a sink(t) and several other nodes connected with edges. Each edge has an individual capacity which is the maximum limit of flow that edge could allow.

It is defined as the maximum amount of flow that the network would allow to flow from source to sink. Multiple algorithms exist in solving the maximum flow problem. Two major algorithms to solve these kind of problems are Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds Karp and Dinic's algorithm.
