## What is a Spanning Tree?
A Spanning tree is a subset to a connected graph G, where all the edges are connected, i.e, one can traverse to any edge from a particular edge with or without intermediates. Also, a spanning tree must not have any cycle in it. Thus we can say that if there are N vertices in a connected graph then the no. of edges that a spanning tree may have is N-1.

## What is a Minimum Spanning Tree? 
Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

Steps for solving the algorithm:

1)Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight. 
2)Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it. (This step uses the Union-Find algorithm to detect cycles). 
3)Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
Kruskalâ€™s algorithm to find the minimum cost spanning tree uses the greedy approach. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that does not cause a cycle in the MST constructed so far.
