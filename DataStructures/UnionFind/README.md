# Union-find 
This algorithm is an algorithm that performs two main operations on such a data structure:

1)Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.

2)Union: Join two subsets into a single subset. Here first we have to check if the two subsets belong to same set. If no, then we cannot perform union. 

The algorithm solves problems wher yo have to find conecctions between sets of nodes, if there is any, or join the sets of nodes and connect them.
