# ALGORITMIC II

This repo it's meant to store all the algorithms seen in the Algorithmic-2-2022 class, it will contain the base code of all them, along with **README** files that will explain a little bit of how these algorithms works and how are they're implemented in c++, it also contain some exercises to practice the implementation an use of the algorithms.

This repo also contain links to helpful videos and site's that help to the understanding of the algorithms as well of their implementations and exercises using the algorithm.
