## Rod Cutting
This algorithm solves a problem where it is necessary to maximize the value that can be obtained given a set with its sub sets for example:

Given a rod of length n inches and a price matrix that includes the prices of all parts of size less than n. Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting the rod and selling the pieces. For example, if the length of the rod is 8 and the values of the different pieces are as follows, then the maximum value obtainable is 22 (by cutting into two pieces of lengths 2 and 6).

length   | 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  
--------------------------------------------
price    | 1   5   8   9  10  17  17  20

The prices are as follows, so the maximum value obtainable is 24 (cutting into eight pieces of length 1).

length   | 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  
--------------------------------------------
price    | 3   5   8   9  10  17  17  20
