- BACKTRACKING

Remember:
Solution Methods:

1.Brute Force -> Try every path (complete search)
2.Greedy -> (Always assumes that it's correct)
3.Dynamic Programming -> (Divide and conquer) Resursion and iterations

Every case    Delete the branches/wrong solutions

- We already have the solutions that work's and the ones that don't
- If i have a goal and one on of the branches if i follow that path i will already contain a wrong answer i can delete all the
possible branches that follow the one that ruin the answer, that way we save time by not exploring all the branches
